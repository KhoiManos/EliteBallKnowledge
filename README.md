# EliteBallKnowledge

Hey wsg Chat!

This is my Elite Ball Knowledge Translator. Starting with Gen Z and accelerating in Gen Alpha, internet language is constantly evolving at a rapid pace.
A lot of terminology (or as some might call it, "Elite Ball Knowledge") is required to fully understand day-to-day conversations nowadays.

Therefore, my translator rephrases "Brain Rot Language" â€” or so-called "Elite Ball Knowledge" terms â€” into clear, technical, and professional sentences or expressions.

__Features:__

- Translates modern internet slang into clear, technical language  
- Supports Gen Z and Gen Alpha slang variants  
- Uses threading to speed up API requests
- Expandable slang dictionary for continuous updates

__So don't be an NPC and have a W Vibe Check on my peak project, so you don't gotta hellyante around the internet like a cooked mango ðŸ¥­ anymore!__
