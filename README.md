# EliteBallKnowledge

Hey!

This is my Elite Ball Knowledge Translator. Starting with Gen Z and accelerating in Gen Alpha, internet language is constantly evolving at a rapid pace.

A lot of terminology (or as some might call it, "Elite Ball Knowledge") is required to fully understand day-to-day conversations nowadays.

Therefore, my translator rephrases "Brain Rot Language" — or so-called "Elite Ball Knowledge" terms — into clear, technical, and professional sentences or expressions.

**So don't be an NPC and have a W Vibe Check on my peak project, so you don't "what the hellyante" around the internet like a cooked mango anymore!
